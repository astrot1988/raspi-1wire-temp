Provides a high-level interface to a "[1-wire](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/1_wire)"
compatible device or file on a Raspberry Pi.

This code was really only tested with a DS18B20 on a Raspberry Pi 3.  I would
very much appreciate testers with different hardware to test and use this 
module.

## Installation

`npm install raspi-1wire-temp`

## Usage

### Finding Devices

The idea with this approach is for R1WT to automatically determine what type of
temperature controller to create.  Currently this project only supports the 
output from a DS18B20 device.  However if/when more temperature sensors are
tested they could be integrated into R1WT relatively easy.

```
const r1wt = require('raspi-1wire-temp');
const devices = r1wt.findDevices();
```

By default, R1WT looks for devices that can be globbed with 
`/sys/bus/w1/devices/28-*/w1_slave`.  However, `findDevices()` method has an
optional _hint_ glob string that can help R1WT find the device files.

```
const r1wt = require('raspi-1wire-temp');
const devices = r1wt.findDevices('/dev/my/temp/sensor*.dev');
```

The `findDevices()` method will return a non-null array of filenames to devices.

### Creating A Device Controller

Once you obtain the filename of a device, either through `findDevices()` or from
a known location, the `fromDevice()` method is used to create the temperature 
controller.

```
const r1wt = require('raspi-1wire-temp');
const devices = r1wt.findDevices();
assert(devices.length > 0);

const controller = r1wt.fromDevice(devices[0]);
console.log(controller.current.celsius)
console.log(controller.current.fahrenheit)
```

For every call to `controller.current` the controller will re-read the device
for the current temperature.  If reading from the device is an expensive call it 
might be wise to cache the current temperature object for some time.

### Create an Emulated Controller

For some contexts, like testing, you might need a stubbed or emulated device 
controller.  The `fromStream()` method can be used to provide this
functionality.  This may be particularly useful when developing software on 
non-RPI hardware.  Effectively allowing a temperature sensor to be emulated with
a known stream of data.

```
const r1wt = require('raspi-1wire-temp');
const controller = r1wt.fromStream(false, 1000, 2000, 3000)

assert(controller.current.celsius == 1000);
assert(controller.current.celsius == 2000);
assert(controller.current.celsius == 3000);
```

The first argument to `fromStream()` is a flag indicating if the stream should
repeat.  When set to `false` the stream will raise an error when the data has
been exhausted.  To repeat the stream, set the flag to `true`.

```
const r1wt = require('raspi-1wire-temp');
const controller = r1wt.fromStream(true, 1000, 2000, 3000)

assert(controller.current.celsius == 1000);
assert(controller.current.celsius == 2000);
assert(controller.current.celsius == 3000);

assert(controller.current.celsius == 1000);
assert(controller.current.celsius == 2000);
assert(controller.current.celsius == 3000);

// etcetera . . .
```

## Tests

```
npm run test
npm run cover
```
